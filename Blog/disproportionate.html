			Some sloppy analytics have been pushed out by various media sources in recent days in

			Thinking that other social inequalities should
			be addressed before police shootings is a valid argument, but unequal educational

			effects are much more subtle, so BLM (Black Lives Matter) has an urgent and emotional
			nature.  Many black boys grow up in an environment where the

				title="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/the-near-certainty-of-anti-police-violence/490541/">police lack legitimacy</a>
			, and their authority comes merely due to superior force of arms.  This makes for a legal
			authority that appears no different than another street gang.  Many black men don’t
			perceive that they will receive justice in the legal and court system, so violence becomes
			the default system of authority.  These perceptions of legal bias are somewhat
			<a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=702"
				title="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=702">corroborated by the data</a>
			. The very fact that BLM is addressing the police and legal
			system is a positive sign that the legal and court systems are being perceived as more of
			an authority by black communities.  Now is the time to support that effort, not hinder it.
			</div>
		<div id="text5" class="text text_normal">
			<a class="section_title"><div id="Two2" class="two"></div>  Cops do kill more white people than black people.</a>
			</br>
			</br>
			This statement is true, and the most obvious counter is to say that the
			<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF"
				title="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF">60+% white population</a>

				title="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF">12% black population</a>
			, but this would also be a sloppy analysis if we
			stopped there.  The story of one member of the population is not statistically analogous to
			another person’s story in every situation.  What if one group is more often engaged in
			dangerous situations with the police?  There are real stories behind this data.
			</br>
			</br>
			So, what exactly is the story here?  We have a movement concerned about the apparent unjust
			shootings of black men.  What would constitute an unjust shooting?  First, a reasonable person
			(remember, all sides to an argument will have unreasonable people, but let’s focus on the
			general consensus) will argue that a non-attacking and nonthreatening person does not deserve
			to be shot.  Second, shooting an unarmed person is often considered not justifiable (certain
			circumstances may justify shooting a threatening unarmed person, but the argument for more
			nonlethal options to these situations is an important topic not under discussion here).  So, what
			data do we have on these types of stories where unarmed and/or non-attacking people are
			killed by police?
		</div>
		<div id="text6" class="text text_normal">
			For over a year and a half, the Washington Post has
			<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/"
				title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/">tracked police shootings</a>
			in the United States.  Of the 1,365 police shootings of confirmed white, black, and Hispanic suspects,
			the majority are white (732), while 381 are black.  However, 44.4% of black suspects were not attacking,
			while only 36.8% of white suspects were not attacking.  As you can see, the Hispanic population deserves an
			investigation into that spike to over 50%, but that is for another time.

		<div id="text7" class="text text_normal">
			Now let’s add unarmed to nonattacking.  White people are at an advantage with unarmed suspects shootings
			only at 7% compared to nearly 12% for blacks.

		<div id="text8" class="text text_normal">
			Now let’s dig into the meat of the story.  Let’s use non-attacking as the base of the data since a
			reasonable person would conclude that deadly force would not be needed in non-attacking
			situations.  Of all non-attacking white suspects, 23.7% were unarmed while 36.3% of black non-
			attacking suspects were unarmed, a 12.6% discrepancy.

			Perhaps these differences seem small to you.  Even this amount of a difference in policing has a
			distinct societal effect that compounds other social wounds.  This data comes from real stories,
			and close investigation may reveal some of the shootings of unarmed non-attacking black men
			were justified.  However, there is a clear difference in how black men are handled in these
			situations.  Is that due to the color of their skin?  Is this symptomatic of intentional racism, or is
			there some type of psychological bias in our society toward dark skin that makes many people
			assume bad intentions?  These questions deserve answers precisely because we have these
			serious symptoms.

		<div id="text10" class="text text_normal">
			To counter BLM with “All Lives Matter” is to either deliberately suppress the concerns of fellow
			citizens or to unintuitively misinterpret their intentions.  You may not agree with their
			arguments or their methods, but the data is clear; Black Lives Matter at least deserves your
			empathy.
